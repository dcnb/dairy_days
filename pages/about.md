## About Dairy Days
The first Meridian dairy show was held on June 18, 1929 to celebrate the opening of the Meridian Creamery. The first show was a way for Meridian's Jersey breeders and 4-H members to exhibit their stock. The Ada County Dairymen's Association, Meridian businessmen as well as the Jersey breeders were early sponsors of the show. There were initially more animals exhibited at the show than people attending. As the years passed, additional events including a parade, pageant and carnival were added to the annual show. Today, subdivisions have replaced the large dairy farms that used to exist, but the dairy show still takes place in the spirit of Meridian's rich history.
